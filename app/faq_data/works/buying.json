		"question": "Can I pay with KeySavvy if the seller has a loan or lien?",
		"answer": "Yes, KeySavvy enables you to purchase a vehicle when the seller still has a loan or lien. In a typical private party sale, the seller can't transfer ownership to you without first paying off their loan. Paying a seller with cash or a cashier's check and not receiving the title right away is risky for buyers. Because KeySavvy is a licensed dealer, we can handle the loan payoff and sale as part of the purchase process, and issue a temporary permit that allows you to legally drive the car right away.
