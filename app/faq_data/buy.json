	{
		"question": "How is the title transferred?",
		"answer": "KeySavvy processes transactions as a dealer by buying the vehicle from the seller and selling it to the buyer. This process enables us to verify titles, issue temporary permits and access DMV data that would otherwise be inaccessible. To process the transaction as a dealer, we need to receive the title from the seller or their lienholder. If the seller has their title, we'll provide detailed instructions for signing and mailing it to KeySavvy. Upon receipt, we'll reassign it to the buyer and ship it with tracking to the buyer's mailing address. If the seller has a loan and doesn't have their title, we'll mail the seller a power of attorney form and a return envelope. This allows us to sign the title on their behalf when we receive it from the lienholder."

		"question": "Do I have to pay taxes and registration fees?",
		"answer": "Yes, in order to register your vehicle, you will need to pay taxes and registration fees to your state. KeySavvy doesn't collect taxes and fees when you pay for your vehicle, except for Minnesota residents. For all other states, you'll pay taxes and fees when registering the vehicle at your local DMV. Some states exempt certain private party sales from tax and we'll notify you if we see you'll pay more in taxes as a result of us processing your transaction as a dealer. If you're a Minnesota resident, KeySavvy will register the vehicle for you. We'll reach out to collect additional information, such as a picture of your insurance card and your preference for license plates."

		"question": "How is KeySavvy different from PayPal and other payment services?",
		"answer": "Unlike payment apps like PayPal and Cash App, KeySavvy verifies the buyer's identity and the seller's ownership of the vehicle. We guarantee buyers receive a clear title and sellers get paid. In contrast, PayPal explicitly excludes vehicles from purchase protection. Other peer-to-peer payment services are primarily intended for smaller transactions between friends and family. They have limits that are much lower than a typical vehicle sale price. KeySavvy has no transaction limit and guides buyers and sellers through the process, including help with all the necessary paperwork and title transfer. As a licensed dealer, we have access to data that enables more thorough verification and helpful services like temporary operating permits."

		"question": "Can I pay with KeySavvy if the seller has a loan or lien?",
		"answer": "Yes, KeySavvy enables you to purchase a vehicle when the seller still has a loan or lien. In a typical private party sale, the seller can't transfer ownership to you without first paying off their loan. Paying a seller with cash or a cashier's check and not receiving the title right away is risky for buyers. Because KeySavvy is a licensed dealer, we can handle the loan payoff and sale as part of the purchase process, and issue a temporary permit that allows you to legally drive the car right away.
